* Function:         void InitSymbolTimer()
*
* PreCondition:     none
*
* Input:		    none
*
* Output:		    none
*
* Side Effects:	    TMR0 for PIC18 is configured for calculating
*                   the correct symbol times.  TMR2/3 for PIC24/dsPIC
*                   is configured for calculating the correct symbol
*                   times
*
* Overview:		    This function will configure the UART for use at 
*                   in 8 bits, 1 stop, no flowcontrol mode
*
* Note:			    The timer interrupt is enabled causing the timer
*                   roll over calculations.  Interrupts are required
*                   to be enabled in order to extend the timer to
*                   4 bytes in PIC18.  PIC24/dsPIC version do not 
*                   enable or require interrupts

* Function:         void InitSymbolTimer()
*
* PreCondition:     none
*
* Input:		    none
*
* Output:		    MIWI_TICK - the current symbol time
*
* Side Effects:	    PIC18 only: the timer interrupt is disabled
*                   for several instruction cycles while the 
*                   timer value is grabbed.  This is to prevent a
*                   rollover from incrementing the timer extenders
*                   during the read of their values
*
* Overview:		    This function returns the current time
*
* Note:			    PIC18 only:
*                   caution: this function should never be called 
*                   when interrupts are disabled if interrupts are 
*                   disabled when this is called then the timer 
*                   might rollover and the byte extension would not 
*                   get updated.
